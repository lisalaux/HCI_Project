This program simulates the interaction with a head-up display (HUD) in a car.

It has been developed for the Human-Computer Interaction course at
the University of Glasgow in 2018 by Team X.

1. Functionality
The program allows a user to navigate through a multi-layer control
system in a car. In particular, a user can switch to the smart home submenu,
which allows to adjust the heating temperature and lock the house door.
The control buttons on a steering wheel are simulated using the keyboard.

2. Key mapping
G = Start the program
H = Quit the program
LEFT ARROW = Navigate left in the menu
RIGHT ARROW = Navigate right in the menu
UP ARROW = Adjust the controls to the top
DOWN ARROW = Adjust the controls to the bottom
A = Go a level down in the menu hierarchy (=select)
Q = Go a level up in the menu hierarchy (=undo)

3. Miscellaneous
In order to allow for tracking of user interaction with the program
and thereby improve the HUD car control system, a log file
called HUD_Prototype.log is produced after the program terminates.
